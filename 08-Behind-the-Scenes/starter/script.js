/*
Java script is:

High-level, i.e. it automates certain functionalities that low-level languages don't. Ex.: in C you have to manually alocate memory for variables.

Garbage-collected, i.e. it automatically cleans the memory of unnecessary objects.

Interpreted/just-in-time compiled, i.e. converted to machine language as required instead of being compiled in advance.

Multi-paradigm, i.e. the code can be structured in multiple ways, procedural, object-oriented, functional programming, it's all compatible.

Prototybe-based object-oriented, i.e. prototypes store all methods applicable to the different objects. Ex.: using .push on an array, the array is an object, .push is a reference to a method determined in the Array prototype.

First-class functions, i.e. fuctions are treated as any other variables, which means we can pass them into other functions or even return them.

Dynamic, i.e. the type of variable can easily be changed as it's determined as the code is read.

Single-threaded, i.e. it does one thing at a time, so it needs a concurrency model to know how to handle multiple tasks happening at the same time.

Non-blocking event loop, i.e. it takes long running tasks and executes them in the background before putting them back in the main thread.

/* JS Engine: Program that executes Javascript code. Ex.: Google V8 that powers Google Chrome and NodeJS.

Call stack: Where the code is executed.

Heap: Where objects are stored in memory.

Compilation vs Interpretation: In compilation the entire code is converted to machine code at once and is executed later (.exe file for example), in interpretation the interpreter runs through the code, converts it to machine code and executes it line by line. Javascript runs a mix of both (Just-in-time compilation), converting the entire code at once and then executing it immediatly.

JIT compilation: Parsing (reading the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree), the AST is then compiled into machine code and then the compiled code is executed right away. As the code is running there's an automatic optimization process happening which replaces the compiled code and then executes it.

JS Runtime: Includes all the things that we need to use JavaScript. At the heart is a JS Engine but it also needs API (functionalities provided to the engine but that aren't part of vanila JS) and a callback queue (contains all the callback functions that are ready to be executed, click/time/data/...)
*/

/* Execution contexts and the call stack

After compiling the code is ready to be executed

Execution context: Environment in which a piece of Javascript is executed, where the information necessary to execute the code is stored.

1) Creation of the global execution context for top-level code that's outside of function. Ex.: global variables and registering functions without executing them.

2) Execution of top-level code that's inside the GEC.

3) Execution of functions and waiting for callbacks.

Execution context in detail:

Inside (generated right before execution):
     Variable environment (variables, functions, arguments object)
     Scope chain (variables located outside the current function)
     "this" keyword

The call stack is what keeps track of the order of execution of all the execution contexts.
*/

/* Scope and the scope chain

Scoping : How the program variable are organized and accessed.

Lexical scoping: Scoping is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code.

The scope: Space in which a certain variable is declaged (global, function, block).

Scope of a variable: Region of the code where a variable can be accessed.

Global scope: Outside any funciton or block, accessible everywhere.

Function scope: also called local scope, variables declared in it only accessible in it.

Block scope (inside {}): Variables only accessible inside the block, only applies to let and const variables, if declared with var then it will be accessible outside the block. An if statement is an example of a block.

Scope chain: The child scope has access to all variables in the parent scope, it's a one way street

/* Hoisting: Makes some types of variables accessible in the code before they are actually declared. During the creating phase the code is scanned to find the variables and a property is created for each one of them in the "variable environment object". 

Hoisting doesn't work the same for all variable types.

  Function declaration: Hoisted, initial value = actual function, scope = block (strict mode only)

  var variables:  Hoisted, initial value = undefined, scope = function

  let and const variables: Not hoisted, initial value = uninitialized (Temporal Dead Zone), scope = block

  function expressions and arrows: based on if declared using var or let/const

Temporal Dead Zone:

const myName = `Mathieu`;
if (myName === `Mathieu`){
  console.log(`Mathieu is a ${job}`);
  const job = `CSR`;
}

    In the above example console.log(...) is in the Temporal Dead Zone for the job variable, which means the variable exist but isn't accessible because it hasn't been initialized yet. It will result in: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'job' before initialization

The reason for TDZ makes it easier to avoir and catch errors (accessing variables before declaration should be avoided), makes const variables work the way they're supposed to.

Why hoisting?

  Using function before actual declaration
  var hoisting is just a byproduct
